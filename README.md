## Project Introduction

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! In this hands-on coding exercise, you'll be building a simple recipe website from scratch. This project will allow you to demonstrate your skills in HTML and web page structuring, as well as linking between pages. You'll create an index page that serves as the homepage for your recipe website and individual recipe pages that contain detailed information about each dish, including images, descriptions, ingredients, and steps.

### By the end of this project, you will have demonstrated the following

#### 1. HTML Basics

- You'll become familiar with the basics of HTML, including creating and structuring web pages.

#### 2. Linking Pages

- You'll learn how to link multiple web pages together to create a cohesive website.

#### 3. Adding Images

- You'll understand how to incorporate images into your web pages to enhance the visual appeal.

#### 4. Organizing Content

- You'll practice organizing and presenting content effectively using headings, paragraphs, lists, and more.

This project is a great opportunity to apply what you've learned about HTML in a practical and fun way. Let's get started and create a delicious-looking recipe website!
